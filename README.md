# Management and Content Delivery
Simulating and analyzing queuing systems for optimizing network performance and production line management in Industry 4.0 environments. This project explores buffer management, server assignment algorithms, and service time distributions in various network scenarios.

Lab 1: Router Queuing System Simulation
We modeled the output link of a router as a queuing system to study its performance under various conditions. Key areas of focus include:
System Behavior Analysis: We analyzed the impact of different arrival rates on key performance metrics such as delay, packet loss, and server utilization.
Buffer Size Impact: We experimented with different buffer sizes in both single-server (M/M/1) and multi-server (M/M/2) configurations. Our findings showed that larger buffers significantly reduce packet loss in high-traffic scenarios.

Lab 2: Industry 4.0 Queuing System
In this lab, we simulated a queuing system in an Industry 4.0 context to optimize production line management. The lab focused on:

Buffer Management in Data Centers: We explored how buffer sizes at the Micro and Cloud Data Centers affect system performance. Larger buffers at the Micro Data Center level were particularly effective in reducing congestion and packet drop rates.
Server Assignment Algorithms: We tested various algorithms (e.g., random, round-robin, and fastest-server assignment) to optimize load distribution. Round-robin proved to be the most effective in balancing the workload and minimizing delays.
